# Carbon-footprint-optimization-in-supply-chain-logitics-

This project aims to minimize CO₂ emissions in last-mile delivery or supply chain routing by optimizing transportation routes using Google OR-Tools. It considers vehicle emission rates, travel distances, and logistics planning to achieve a more sustainable supply chain.

## 🔍 Features
->  Route optimization using Google OR-Tools

->  CO₂ emissions calculation per route

->  Configurable distance matrix

->  Easily extendable to multi-vehicle, load optimization, or real-time data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
->  Python 3

->  Google OR-Tools (for route optimization)

->  NumPy (for potential matrix operations)
