# carbon-footprint-optimization-in-supply-chain-logitics-

This project aims to minimize CO‚ÇÇ emissions in last-mile delivery or supply chain routing by optimizing transportation routes using Google OR-Tools. It considers vehicle emission rates, travel distances, and logistics planning to achieve a more sustainable supply chain.

## üîç Features
Route optimization using Google OR-Tools

CO‚ÇÇ emissions calculation per route

Configurable distance matrix

Easily extendable to multi-vehicle, load optimization, or real-time data

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python 3

Google OR-Tools (for route optimization)

NumPy (for potential matrix operations)
